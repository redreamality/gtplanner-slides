use @c:\Users\Remy\sensedeal\code\slides\opensqz-theme/assets\people-mask.png and @c:\Users\Remy\sensedeal\code\slides\opensqz-theme/assets\content-mask.png for content masking. Strictly follow the UI design in `docs/`, do NOT modify the design arbitrarily

----

Create a Slidev layout component for a content page that exactly matches the visual design shown in the reference image. The layout must include these specific elements in their exact positions:

**Background and Base Structure:**
- Use `/assets/background.jpg` as the full-screen background image (cover the entire slide)
- Apply a semi-transparent white overlay (rgba mask) over the background to ensure text readability

**Header Section:**
- Position the page title in the top-left corner of the slide
- Position the SQZ logo (`/assets/SQZ-logo.png`) in the top-right corner of the slide
- Both title and logo should be in a header area with appropriate spacing

**Content Area:**
- Create a main content area below the header where slide content will be displayed
- Ensure the semi-transparent white mask covers this content area for optimal text contrast
- Style typography (headings, paragraphs, lists, code blocks) for dark text on the light background

**Footer Element:**
- Add a thin horizontal space at the bottom of the slide as shown in the reference image (just simple let the content-mask leave some space to the bottom)

**Technical Requirements:**
- Create this as a Vue.js single-file component in `layouts/title-content.vue`
- Use Tailwind CSS classes and scoped styles
- Make the layout responsive for different screen sizes
- Accept a `title` prop from frontmatter to display in the top-left
- Provide a `<slot />` for the main content area
- Ensure proper z-index layering for all elements
